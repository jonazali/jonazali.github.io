##Fleet Marine Force Mobile Application
When a U.S Sailor is integrated into the United States Marine Corps, they must prepare for an exam called the "Fleet Marine Force". This exam tests the U.S Sailor's knowledge of the United States Marine Corps' structure, history, and values. My team consisting of developers associated with the U.S Navy and Marine Corps, created an application which provides mock exams and incentives for U.S sailors to study for their Fleet Marine Force Exam.
